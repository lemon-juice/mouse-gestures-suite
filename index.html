        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <strong>Mouse Gestures Suite</strong> is based on (abandoned) Firefox
        extension <i>All-in-One Gestures</i> and has been modified to work with
        <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Seamonkey</strong></a>
        and later also with Firefox (since ver. 1.5.0). Many fixes and
        improvements have been made and new features added.<br>
        <br>
        Main features:<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Mouse gestures</strong> - performed by moving the mouse with a
        button depressed allow you to quickly navigate through pages, open/close
        tabs and windows and perform many other commands without having to use
        toolbar buttons, menus or keyboard shortcuts. A gesture consists of a
        series of mouse movements in one of 4 directions (up, down, left,
        right).<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Rocker gestures</strong> - invoked by pressing one mouse button
        and then the other while keeping the first one pressed. By default used
        to go back and forward in browsing history but can be customized to do
        something else.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Scroll wheel in tab bar</strong> - you can switch between tabs
        by scrolling mouse wheel over the tab bar.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Scroll wheel navigation</strong> - perform your favourite
        actions by pressing a mouse button and scrolling mouse wheel at the same
        time.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Middle button scrolling</strong> - auto scroll pages or
        textareas by clicking the middle mouse button once (pressing and
        releasing) and then control the scrolling speed by moving the mouse or
        using arrow keys. <i>Grab and Drag</i> options allow you to scroll by
        moving the mouse while the middle button is depressed.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Link tooltip</strong> - see details about links as you hover
        over them with your mouse. Useful especially for browsing without the
        status bar like in full screen mode.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Custom functions</strong> (since version 2.0.0) - apart from a
        list of many predefined actions you can create your own functions for
        mouse gestures. Invoke any item command from the main menu or write your
        own script to execute.<br>
        <br>
        All the above features work in the Browser component. Mouse and rocker
        gestures also work in Mail, Message, Mail Compose and View Page Source
        windows — the gesture movements are the same as those in Browser,
        however not all actions work in those other window types since not all
        of them are applicable there — see help for detailed information.<br>
        <br>
        If you have any other mouse gestures extensions they may conflict with
        each other so please disable or uninstall them before trying out this
        one.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Versions <b>1.7.0</b> and later are compatible with multi-process
          Firefox (e10s). Pale Moon users - please use version 1.6.3 from the <a

            href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/mouse-gestures-suite/versions/1.6.3"

            rel="nofollow">version history</a>.</i> </section>
